# LazyBlog — Markdown Syntax Reference

What you can write inside a `content/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` body.
Anything not listed here is **not** supported.

The rendering pipeline lives in `src/MarkdownRenderer.php`. Parser is
[league/commonmark](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com) v2 + GFM
TableExtension, plus a handful of LazyBlog-specific pre/post processors.

## Standard CommonMark

Everything in the CommonMark 0.31 spec works:

- Headings (`#` … `######`) — H2 and H3 also get auto-injected IDs and
  appear in the post's TOC
- Bold (`**x**`), italic (`*x*`)
- Inline code (`` `x` ``) and fenced code blocks (``` ```lang … ``` ```)
- Lists: unordered (`-`/`*`) and ordered (`1.`)
- Blockquotes (`> …`)
- Links: `[text](url)`, `[text](url "title")`
- Reference-style links: `[text][ref]` + `[ref]: url`
- Horizontal rule: `---` or `***`
- Raw HTML is **allowed** (`html_input => allow`) — useful for one-off
  embeds, but you give up XSS protection for what you write

Not supported (by design — kept the surface small):

- Strikethrough (`~~x~~`)
- Task lists (`- [ ]`)
- Footnotes (`[^1]`)
- Emoji shortcodes (`:smile:`)
- Plain URL autolinking (write `<https://x.com>` or `[label](url)`)

## Tables (GFM)

Pipe-style. The first row is the header; the second is required and
defines per-column alignment.

```markdown
| Frequency | Mode     | Notes               |
|-----------|---------:|:--------------------|
| 14.230 MHz | SSTV    | RX-only window      |
| 144.500 MHz| FM       | Calling, simplex    |
```

Renders full-width with uppercase amber header, dashed row borders, and
alternating row tint. Wide tables scroll horizontally on mobile.

---

## Frequency / unit tags

Any inline `<code>` whose content matches a number + recognized unit gets
auto-promoted into a `<span class="freq-tag">` chip. The chip uses the
accent color so RF / file-size / timing values stand out from the body.

```markdown
The downlink is on `137.625 MHz` and each pass writes about `8 MB` of IQ.
```

Recognized units: `Hz, kHz, MHz, GHz, MB, GB, TB, ms, s, min, km, m, cm, mm`

Inline code that isn't a number + unit (e.g. `` `rsync` ``, `` `.env` ``)
renders as a normal code span.

## Standalone images → full-width figure

A line containing **only** `![alt](url)` gets wrapped in
`<figure class="post-figure">`. The figure breaks out of the article
column to viewport width on desktop, applies a `mix-blend-mode: multiply`
overlay in the theme color (so photos feel native to the phosphor
aesthetic), and shows the alt text as a centered `<figcaption>` below.

```markdown
![Hai chiếc dish array nhìn từ rooftop, hoàng hôn cam](https://example.com/photo.jpg)
```

Surrounding blank lines are inserted for you, so this also works inside
flowing prose:

```markdown
This is the paragraph just before the photo.
![Caption goes here](https://example.com/photo.jpg)
And this paragraph comes right after.
```

To embed an image inline (not full-width, no caption), drop it inside a
sentence — `see the diagram ![arrow](…) over here` — and it renders as a
plain inline `<img>`.

---

## YouTube auto-embed

A line containing **only** a YouTube URL becomes a 16:9 iframe embed
(privacy-friendly `youtube-nocookie.com` domain, `loading="lazy"`).
Supported URL shapes:

```markdown
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ

https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ
```

The same blank-line auto-insertion as images applies — write the URL on
its own line and it gets promoted to a paragraph automatically.

URLs inside prose (`check this https://youtu.be/abc video`) and inside
fenced code blocks render as literal text, not embeds.

---

## Admonitions

Two block-level callouts using a `:::` fence.

### Highlight box

For a "key fact / callout" panel. Renders as `<div class="highlight-box">`
with a phosphor-tinted background.

```markdown
::: highlight
SSTV transmissions are slow but resilient — a 36-second image can
survive QSB that would kill a fast digital mode.
:::
```

The body inside `:::` is recursively rendered as markdown — lists, bold,
links, frequency tags all work.

### Story card

For a longer narrative block, with optional icon + title.

```markdown
::: story icon="🌕" title="First contact"
On a January night in 2024, the dish picked up a faint birdie at
137.100 MHz. It turned out to be METEOR M N2-3 — a satellite I hadn't
even confirmed was alive.
:::
```

The `icon=""` and `title=""` attrs are optional. Body is markdown.

---

## Heading IDs + TOC

Every `<h2>` and `<h3>` in the post body gets:

- An auto-generated ID derived from the heading text (kebab-case,
  ASCII-folded for Vietnamese diacritics) — so you can link to
  `/posts/slug#tieu-de-cua-toi`
- An entry in the post's auto-generated table of contents (the
  `§ TOC — NAVIGATION` box at the top of every post)

You don't need to do anything to opt in. To opt **out** of the TOC for a
specific heading, use H4+ (`####` etc.) — those aren't tracked.

---

## File and frontmatter conventions

For completeness — these aren't markdown syntax but they determine how
the file is picked up at all:

- Filename: `content/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` (the date and slug get
  parsed out of the filename)
- Frontmatter is YAML, fenced by `---`:

```yaml
---
title: "SSTV — Hình Ảnh Qua Sóng Radio"
date: "2026-06-22"
author: "XV5HP"
tags: [radio, sstv, ham]
draft: false
summary: "Decode SSTV images off the air with $20 of hardware."
icon: "📻"
---
```

Required: `title`, `date`. Everything else is optional. `draft: true`
hides the post from listings and feeds (but the file at
`/posts/{slug}.md` is still served if someone knows the URL).
